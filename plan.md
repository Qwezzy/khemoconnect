# Project Brief: KhemoConnect 2.0 Website Redesign

## 1. Project Overview
KhemoConnect (a division of Khemo IT Solutions) is pivoting from a traditional web design/hosting agency into a **Modern Digital Transformation & Automation Partner** for South African SMEs. 

We no longer sell "commodity websites." We sell outcome-driven solutions: Website-as-a-Service (WaaS), AI-powered business automation, and secure Digital Workspaces (SharePoint/M365). The new website must reflect a premium, authoritative, and modern tech-forward brand.

## 2. Target Audience
* **Primary:** South African SME Owners, Founders, and Operations Managers (Medical practices, Legal firms, Logistics, Construction, Retail).
* **Pain Points:** Wasting time on manual admin tasks, old websites that don't generate leads, fear of POPIA compliance fines, remote-work communication breakdowns.
* **Goal:** They want to save time, increase revenue, and look like a top-tier brand without managing the tech themselves.

## 3. Brand Identity & Vibe
* **Tone:** Confident, Consultative, Innovative, and Transparent. (We are the experts so they don't have to be).
* **Visual Style:** Clean, minimalist, tech-forward. High use of negative space, bold typography. Dark mode options with vibrant accent colors (e.g., Deep Navy Blue, Electric Cyan, and Crisp White).
* **Core Messaging Framework:** "Irresistible Offers" (Alex Hormozi style) – emphasizing Risk Reversal, High ROI, and Done-For-You (DFY) execution.

## 4. Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) to Highlight
1. **Zero-Upfront Website as a Service (WaaS):** Enterprise-grade web design, hosting, and maintenance on a flat monthly subscription. 
2. **AI-Powered Automation:** Seamless integration between the website, CRM, and communication channels (Automated lead scoring, WhatsApp bots, automated quoting).
3. **100% POPIA Compliant & Secure:** Enterprise-grade security and local data compliance baked into every project.

## 5. Sitemap & Page Structure
